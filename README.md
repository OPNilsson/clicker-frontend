# Clicker-Project
A clicker game developed for [Cloud Development](https://www.hkr.se/en/course/DA376D/course-syllabus) course at HKR.

The project is divided into two parts:
[The Cloud Backend](https://hkr-clicker-cloud.herokuapp.com/) & [The Frontend Website](https://hkr-clicker-frontend.herokuapp.com/)

both these parts are hosted on Heroku but in different applications.
They are both using github actions to have automatic deployement to the cloud and as such have been placed in seperate github repositories. 

This README file contains the descriptions relevant to the frontend portion of the project for more please reffer to the Cloud Repository

## The Frontend Website
The frontend is made up by a website GUI that interacts with the backend using Ajax Calls.
